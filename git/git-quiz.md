## Git

#### Q1. How can you check your current git version?

- [ ] git --v
- [x] git --version
- [ ] git --option
- [ ] git --current

#### Q2. What command lets you create a connection between a local and remote repository?

- [ ] git remote add new
- [x] git remote add origin
- [ ] git remote new origin
- [ ] git remote origin

[Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20291731/how-to-connect-to-a-remote-git-repository)

#### Q3. Describe what these Git commands do to the commit history:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~5
git merge --squash HEAD@{1}
```

- [ ] They reset the HEAD to the fifth commit in the repo, then merge to the master branch.
- [x] The current branch's HEAD is reset back five commits, then prior commits are squashed into a single commit.
- [ ] They delete the last five commits.
- [ ] They merge the last five commits into a new branch.

**Explanation:**

- `git reset --hard HEAD~5` resets the current branch to the commit just before the last 5 (see `man gitrevisions` for details about this notation and other cool alternatives like `HEAD@{2 days ago}`). As it is a hard reset, it will also overwrite every change in the working tree as well. See `man git-reset`.
- `git merge --squash HEAD@{1}` HEAD@{1} is where the branch was just before the previous command (again, see `man gitrevisions`). This command sets the state of the index to be as it would just after a merge from that commit. This whole operation could be a way to take 5 commits from a branch in which you started a new feature and squash them to a single commit, a meaningful one.

#### Q4. Your current project has several branches; master, beta, and push-notifications. You've just finished the notification feature in the push-notification branch, and you want to commit it to beta branch. How can you accomplish this?

- [ ] Checkout the push-notifications branch and run git merge beta
- [ ] Checkout the master branch and run git merge beta -> push-notifications
- [ ] Delete the push-notifications branch and it will be committed to the master branch automatically
- [x] Checkout the beta branch and run git merge push-notifications

#### Q5. Which of the following is true you when you use the following command?

`git add -A`

- [x] All new and updated files are staged
- [ ] Files are staged in alphabetical order.
- [ ] All new files are staged
- [ ] Only updated files are staged

#### Q6. What will the following command print to the Terminal?

`git remote -v`

- [x] A list of remote repositories and their URLs
- [ ] The current git version you're running
- [ ] An inline editor for modifying remote repositories
- [ ] The last 5 git versions you've installed

#### Q7. Looking at the following commands, describe what is happening.

```bash
git checkout feature-user-location
git cherry-pick kj2342134sdf090093f0sdgasdf99sdfo992mmmf9921231
```

- [ ] The commit is being tagged for release on the feature-user-location branch
- [x] A commit is being copied from its original branch over to the feature-user-location branch
- [ ] The commit is being cherry picked as the new HEAD of the commit history
- [ ] A commit is being copied from the feature-user-location branch to the master branch
- [ ] The branch is switched to the feature-user-location branch, and the specified commit is applied to the branch.

#### Q8. What does the following command do to the git repository?

`git reset --soft HEAD^`

- [ ] It deletes all previous commits and reset the repository history back to its initial state.
- [ ] It resets the working branch to the first commit.
- [ ] It keeps the HEAD at the current commit, but clears all previous commits.
- [x] It sets HEAD to the previous commit and leaves changes from the undone commit in the stage/index.

#### Q9. You find a bug in your project, but can't locate where it was introduced in the commit history. How would you diagnose this problem?

- [ ] Manually backtrack through your commit history.
- [ ] Use git search -diff to compare all commits in your repository history.
- [ ] Run a git rebase to find the buggy commit.
- [x] Use git bisect to compare the buggy commit to an early commit that works as expected.

#### Q10. Why would the following command be used?

`git rebase -i HEAD~10`

- [ ] To run a comparative search of the last 10 commits for differences
- [x] To list the last 10 commits and modify them with either the squash or fixup command
- [ ] To delete the last 10 commits and reset the HEAD
- [ ] In order to locally cache the last 10 commits

#### Q11. Why would you use a pre-receive hook in your remote repository?

- [ ] You wouldn't, you would use it in the local repository
- [x] To execute a script when a remote receives a push that is triggered before any refs are updated
- [ ] To fire a script after updates are made to the remote repository
- [ ] To debug all commit tags and release versions

#### Q12. What option can you use to apply git configurations across your entire git environment?

- [ ] Reflogging

#### Q14. If you cloned an existing git repository, what would happen?

- [ ] A new copy would overwrite the central repository
- [x] A copy of the repository would be created on your local machine

- [ ] A copy of the repository would be created on the hosting platform

#### Q15. How can you display a list of files added or modified in a specific commit?

- [ ] Find the commit in the remote repository, as that's the only place that kind of information is stored.

- [ ] Run `git commit --info` with the commit hash.
- [ ] Access the commit stash data with `git stash`.

#### Q16. What files is this .gitignore programmed to leave out?

```shell
#.swift
build/

*.txt
*.metadata
```

- [ ] All files with a .swift, .txt, or metadata file extension, as well as the entire build directory
- [ ] Only the build directory
- [x] All files in the build directory, as well as files ending with .txt or .metadata
- [ ] Only files with .swift and .txt extensions.

A line starting with `#` serves as a comment. Hence `# .swift` does not do anything. See `man gitignore`.

#### Q17. After you make changes to a local repository, you run the following command. What will this do?

`git commit -a -m "Refactor code base"`

- [ ] Nothing, you can't use multiple options in the same command

(use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
modified: beta-notes.js
Changes not staged for commit:
(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
(use "git checkout --<file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

modified: beta-notes.js
```

- [ ] There were two copies of beta-notes.js but one was deleted
- [x] beta-notes.js was staged, then modified afterwards, creating two different versions of the file

- [ ] ⠀

```bash
  git pull origin master
  git reset --hard origin/myCurrentBranch
```

- [x] ⠀

```bash
  git fetch --all
  git reset --hard origin/master
```

**Note**: - The command `pull` is `fetch` followed by either `merge` or `rebase` (in this case, `merge`). We don't want to merge. Merge would be an action to our **repository**. We just want to overwrite our **local files**.

```bash
  git forget -rf wrongfile
  git commit -m "Removed file"
```

- [ ] ⠀

```bash
  git untrack -rf wrongfile

#### Q129. What is the best way to report a bug to a GitHub project?

- [ ] Send an email to a project owner.
- [ ] I don't bother reporting software bugs because there's no transparency and they never get fixed anyway.
- [x] Search for the bug in the project's existing issues and create a new one if it hasn't been reported yet.
- [ ] Use git search -diff to compare all commits in your repository history.

Explanation: A project's issues are visible to anyone who has access to the project, so you may find a resolution is already planned or available. Otherwise, you can create and track the issue yourself.

#### Q130. Suppose you have created a bug fix on a new branch and want it to become part of the next production build generated from the main branch. What should you do next?

- [ ] Copy your branch changes and commit them directly to the main branch.

- [ ] On second thought, maybe I won't share this fix. I'll just put it in my own private version of the source code.
- [ ] Use git bisect to compare the buggy commit to an early commit that works as expected.

Explanation: Pull requests are the correct way to communicate that commits are ready for review and ultimate inclusion on the main branch.
