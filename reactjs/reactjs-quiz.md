#### Q19. When do you use `useLayoutEffect`?

- [ ] to optimize for all devices
- [ ] to complete the update
- [x] to change the layout of the screen
- [] when you need the browser to paint before the effect runs

[Source] (https://react.dev/reference/react/useLayoutEffect)
"useLayoutEffect is a version of useEffect that fires before the browser repaints the screen."

[Explanation]The correct answer to the question "When do you use useLayoutEffect?" is:

When you need to change the layout of the screen.

useLayoutEffect is used when you need to perform DOM mutations that rely on the updated layout of the elements. It allows you to make changes to the DOM synchronously before the browser performs its painting step. This can be useful when you need to measure or manipulate the layout, such as accessing element dimensions or positions, calculating scroll offsets, or performing other operations that require up-to-date layout information.

The other option provided as answer is not accurate:

"When you need the browser to paint before the effect runs" is not correct. The purpose of useLayoutEffect is to run the effect synchronously after the DOM updates but before the browser paints, allowing you to make layout-related changes before the visual rendering occurs.

**Explanation:**
`useLayoutEffect` gets executed _before_ the `useEffect` hook without much concern for DOM mutation. Even though the React hook `useLayoutEffect` is set after the `useEffect` Hook, it gets triggered first!

#### Q20. What is the difference between the click behaviors of these two buttons (assuming that this.handleClick is bound correctly)?

```javascript
A. <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
B. <button onClick={event => this.handleClick(event)}>Click Me</button>
```

- [ ] Button A will not have access to the event object on click of the button.
- [ ] Button B will not fire the handler this.handleClick successfully.
- [ ] Button A will not fire the handler this.handleClick successfully.
- [x] There is no difference.

#### Q21. How do you destructure the properties that are sent to the Dish component?

```javascript
function Dish(props) {
  return (
    <h1>
      {props.name} {props.cookingTime}
    </h1>
  );
}
```

- [ ] `function Dish([name, cookingTime]) { return <h1>{name} {cookingTime}</h1>; }`
- [x] `function Dish({name, cookingTime}) { return <h1>{name} {cookingTime}</h1>; }`
- [ ] `function Dish(props) { return <h1>{name} {cookingTime}</h1>; }`
- [ ] `function Dish(...props) { return <h1>{name} {cookingTime}</h1>; }`

#### Q22. When might you use `React.PureComponent`?

- [ ] when you do not want your component to have props
- [ ] when you have sibling components that need to be compared
- [x] when you want a default implementation of `shouldComponentUpdate()`
- [ ] when you do not want your component to have state

[Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent)

#### Q23. Why is it important to avoid copying the values of props into a component's state where possible?

- [ ] because you should never mutate state

- [x] because you want to allow a component to update in response to changes in the props
- [ ] because you want to allow data to flow back up to the parent

#### Q24. What is the children prop?

- [ ] a property that adds child components to state
- [x] a special property that JSX creates on components that contain both an opening tag and a closing tag, referencing it's contents.

#### Q38. Why is it a good idea to pass a function to `setState` instead of an object?

- [ ] It provides better encapsulation.
- [ ] It makes sure that the object is not mutated.
- [ ] It automatically updates a component.
- [x] `setState` is asynchronous and might result in out of sync values.

[Reference](https://medium.com/@wisecobbler/using-a-function-in-setstate-instead-of-an-object-1f5cfd6e55d1)

**Explanation:** Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.

- [ ] `React`
- [x] `ReactDOM`

- [ ] The link component allows the user to use the browser's `Back` button.
- [ ] There is no difference--the `Link` component is just another name for the `<a>` tag.

root.render(element);
```

- [x] `createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));`
- [ ] `ReactDOM(element, document.getElementById("root"));`
- [ ] `renderDOM(element, document.getElementById("root"));`

#### Q103. What would you pass to the onClick prop that wil allow you to pass the initName prop into the greet handler?

```javascript
const Greeting = ({ initName }) => {
  const greet = (name) => console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
  return <button onClick={ ... }>Greeting Button </button>
}
```

- [ ] hug
- [ ] this.hug(initName)
- [ ] (name) => this.hug(name)
- [x] () => hug(initName)

Explanation: Apparently the question misstyped `greet` as `hug`. Putting this aside, we can still learn from this question.

- In a function, the global object is the default binding for `this`. In a browser window the global object is [object Window].
  This is a functional Component, so `this` from `this.hug` actually refers to browser window.
  Since it is a functional component, we can directly refer to hug without using `this`.
- To pass a handler to onClick, we should always pass a function rather than execute a function. So we need to use callback here.
  `initName` is available in Greeting's function scope, so we can directly supply as an argument to hug().

- [ ] `function Greeting(name){return <h1>{name}</h1>;}`
- [ ] `const Greeting = props => { <h1>{props.name}</h1> }`
- [x] `const Greeting = ({ name }) => <h1>Hello {name}</h1>;`

#### Q119. Why is the `waitlist` not updating correctly?

  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [waitlist, setWaitlist] = useState([]);
  const onSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    waitlist.push(name);
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
        <label>
          Name: <input type="text" value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
        </label>
        <button type="submit">Add to waitlist</button>
      </form>
