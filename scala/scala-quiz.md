## Scala

#### Q1. Scala bytecode can run on top of Java VM. What is the fundamental difference between Java object.clone() and Scala object.copy()?

- [ ] One is a Java object, the other is a Scala object.
- [ ] clone() will copy class structures but not the data, while copy() will also copy data into new objects.
- [ ] There is no difference.
- [x] copy() allows you to change values during the copying process; clone() does not.

val m1 = Map("a"->1,"b"->2,"c"->3)
m1("a")
```

- [ ] a
- [ ] 2
- [ ] b
- [x] 1

- [ ] ImmutableCollection
- [ ] List
- [x] Tuple

#### Q6. After defining a function in the interpreter, Scala returns the following. What does the `()` indicate?

```
myfnc: ()Unit
```

- [ ] The function has no side effects.
- [ ] The function takes no parameters.
- [x] The function returns no value.
- [ ] Returning unit types to the function is a closures.

- [ ] hexadecimal
- [ ] short
- [x] floating point
- [ ] long

#### Q8. When you convert a map to a list using the `toList` method of the map, the result will be of which type?

[Null in Scala Standard library](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/Null.html). The question is a bit incorrect - Null is a subtype of every type _except those of value classes_

#### Q11. For the for-yield construct, is the scope separate between for-body and yield-body?

- [ ] Yes and no. It is different depending on the for construct and what it does.
- [ ] Yes, because the for section does not expose its scope.
- [x] No, because for-yield shares the same scope, even though they are within separate curly braces.
- [ ] Yes, because they are within different curly braces.

**Example**: yield-body has access to the `e` variable from the for-body

```scala
val a = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
for {
     e <- a if e > 2
} yield e
```

- [ ] `^`
- [ ] `-`

[Pattern Matching](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/pattern-matching.html)

#### Q18. You have created an array using val. Can you change the value of any element of the arrayâ€”and why or why not?

- [x] Yes, the reference to the array is immutable, so the location that the array points to is immutable. The values in the array are mutable.
- [ ] The 0th element is immutable and cannot be modified. All other elements can be modified.
- [ ] Yes, val does not make arrays immutable.
- [ ] No, val makes the array and values of the array immutable.

**Explanation**:

```scala
val a1 = Array(1, 2, 3)
a1{1} = 3 // OK
a1 = Array(1, 3, 3) // error: reassignment to val
```

- [ ] private function
- [ ] block function
- [x] local function
- [ ] method

A function defined within a block of code, such as within a method or another function, is called a local function. This is because it is only visible and accessible within the scope of the block in which it is defined, and is not accessible outside of that block.

```scala
x= List(1,2,4); x(1)?
```

- [ ] (1,2,4)
- [ ] 1
- [ ] Nil
- [x] 2

#### Q51. Which data type does Scala use instead of null for optional values?

- [ ] Nil
- [x] Option
- [ ] Singleton
- [ ] Collection

In Scala, the Option data type is used instead of null for optional values. It is a container that can either hold a value or be empty, and it is used to represent the presence or absence of a value. This makes it safer to work with than using null, as it eliminates the risk of null pointer exceptions.

#### Q52. What is equivalent to this code?

```val a = "baz"
s"Foo $a?"
```

- [x] "Foo " + a + "?"

#### Q53. Which expression is one way to iterate over a collection and generate a collection of each iteration's result?

- [x] for-yield
- [ ] for-collect
- [ ] for-collect until
- [ ] collectuntil
- for-yield is one way to iterate over a collection and generate a collection of each iteration's result. The for loop with the yield keyword is used to iterate over a collection and generate a new collection with the results of each iteration.

#### Q54. Which statement accesses the third element of an array named foo?

- [x] foo[2]
- [ ] foo(3)
- [ ] foo[3]
- [ ] foo(2)
- In many programming languages, arrays are indexed starting at 0, so the first element of the array is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on. Therefore, to access the third element of an array named "foo", you would use the index 2 (since the array is indexed starting at 0). This can be done using the syntax foo[2] or foo(2) depending on the programming language. In some languages like Java, you can use foo[2] or foo[3] to access the third element.

#### Q55. What data type would you use to store an immutable collection of objects when you don't know how many members will be in the collection?

- [ ] Tuple
- [x] List
- [ ] Object
- [ ] Array
- You would use a List data type to store an immutable collection of objects when you don't know how many members will be in the collection. Lists are indexed collections of elements that can be accessed by their position in the list, and they are commonly used to store collections of items that need to be processed in order. Additionally, Lists are immutable, which means that their elements cannot be modified once they have been created, making them ideal for use cases where data integrity is important.

#### Q56. From where do all classes in Scala inherit?

- [x] AnyRef
- [ ] AnyColl
- [ ] AnyVal
- [ ] AnyClass
- All classes in Scala inherit from the AnyRef class by default. AnyRef is the base class for all reference types in Scala, and it is equivalent to the java.lang.Object class in Java. AnyVal is the base class for all value types in Scala, and Any is the base class for all types in Scala.

#### Q57. In Scala, what is a precondition?

- [ ] A class of boolean operators
- [ ] A class of predefined error messages
- [x] A constraint on values passed to a method or constructor
- [ ] A constraint on where a method may be called from
- A precondition in Scala is a constraint on the input values passed to a method or constructor, specifying the conditions that must be met for the method or constructor to execute correctly. It is used to check the validity of input values before the method or constructor is executed, and can be used to ensure that the method or constructor is called with the correct arguments.

#### Q58. Which code sample will print the integers 1 through 4, each on a separate line?

- [ ] for(i <- 0 to 4) println(i)
- [x] for(i <- 0 to 3) println(i+1)
- [ ] for(i <- 1 to 8 if i < 5) println(i)
- [ ] for(i <- 1 to 4) println(i)
- The correct answer is for(i <- 0 to 3) println(i+1) because it will start the iteration from 0 and end at 3, incrementing the value by 1 each time and printing it.

#### Q59. Which operator should you use to take the intersection of two sets?

- [x] &
- [ ] ||
- [ ] &&
- [ ] %
- The & or intersect method can be used to take the intersection of two sets in Scala.

#### Q60. Which data type does Scala use instead of null for optional values?

- [ ] Nil
- [x] Option
- [ ] Singleton
- [ ] Collection
- In Scala, the Option data type is used instead of null for optional values. It is a container that can either hold a value or be empty, and it is used to represent the presence or absence of a value. This makes it safer to work with than using null, as it eliminates the risk of null pointer exceptions.
