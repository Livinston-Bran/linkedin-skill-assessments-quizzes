#### Q5. Which `cargo` command checks a program for error without creating a binary executable?

- [ ] cargo --version
- [ ] cargo init
- [ ] cargo build
- [x] cargo check

#### Q6. The term _box_ and related phrases such as _boxing a value_ are often used when relating to memory layout. What does _box_ refer to?

- [ ] It's creating a pointer on the heap that points to a value on the stack.
- [x] It's creating a pointer on the stack that points to a value on the heap.
- [ ] It's creating a memory guard around values to prevent illegal access.
- [ ] It's an abstraction that refers to ownership. "Boxed" values are clearly labelled.

#### Q7. What is an alternative way of writing `slice` that produces the same result?

```rust
...
let s = String::form("hello");
let slice = &s[0..2];
```

- [ ] let slice = &s[len + 2];
- [ ] let slice = &s[len - 2];
- [ ] let slice = &s.copy(0..2);
- [x] let slice = &s[..2];

#### Q8. Using the `?` operator at the end of an expression is equivalent to **\_**.

- [ ] a match pattern that branches into True or False
- [ ] calling ok_error()
- [ ] calling panic!()
- [x] a match pattern that may result an early return

#### Q9. Which is valid syntax for defining an array of i32 values?

- [ ] Array<i32>::with_capacity(10)

    } else {
        counts.insert(c, 1);
    };
}
```

- [x]

```rust

    let count = counts.entry(c);
    *count += 1;
}
```

- [ ]

```rust
for c in text.chars() {

#### Q18. Does the `main` function compile? If so, why? If not, what do you need to change?

```rust
fn main() {
    let Some(x) = some_option_value;
}
```

- [ ] The code does not compile. `let` statements require a refutable pattern. Add `if` before `let`.
- [ ] The code compiles. `let` statements sometimes require a refutable pattern.
- [x] The code does not compile. `let` statements requires an irrefutable pattern. Add `if` before `let`.

- [ ] `.into()`

#### Q22. Which statement about the `Clone` and `Copy` traits is false?

- [x] `Copy` is enabled for primitive, built-in types.
- [ ] Without `Copy`, Rust applies move semantics to a type's access.
- [ ] When using `Clone`, copying data is explicit.
- [ ] Until a type implements either `Copy` or `Clone`, its internal data cannot be copied.

[ref from stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41413336/do-all-primitive-types-implement-the-copy-trait)

#### Q23. Why does this code _not_ compile?

```rust
fn returns_closure() -> dyn Fn(i32) -> i32 {
    |x| x + 1
}
```

- [ ] The returned `fn` pointer and value need to be represented by another trait.
- [ ] Closures are types, so they cannot be returned directly from a function.
- [ ] Closures are types and can be returned only if the concrete trait is implemented.
- [x] Closures are represented by traits, so they cannot be a return type.

[Rust book reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-05-advanced-functions-and-closures.html#returning-closures)

fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
}
```

- [x] Both are character literals.
- [ ] `heart_eyed_cat` is an invalid expression.
- [ ] `c` is a string literal and `heart_eyed_cat` is a character literal.
- [ ] Both are string literals.

[Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.char.html)

- [ ] A `&mut T` reference is allowed. However it may not cpexists with any other references. and may be created only in single-threaded code.
- [ ] `UnsafeCell<T>` provides thread-safety. Therefore, creating `&T` references from multiple threads is safe.
- [x] The only safe operation is the `.get()` method, which returns only a raw pointer.
- [ ] Non. `UnsafeCell<T>` only allows code that would otherwise need unsafe blocks to be written in safe code.

[Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/cell/struct.UnsafeCell.html)

#### Q35. Generics are useful when you **\_**.

- [ ] need to reduce code duplication by concretizing values and restricting parameters in functions
