```

- [x] :

```tsql
  SELECT GameType, MaxPlayers, count(*) AS NumberOfGames
  FROM Games
  GROUP BY GameType, MaxPlayers
  ORDER BY GameType;
```

- [ ] :

```tsql
  SELECT GameType, count(Players) AS MaxPlayers, NumberOfGames
  FROM Games
  GROUP BY GameType, MaxPlayers
  ORDER BY GameType;
```

- [ ] :

```tsql

```

```

- [ ] 1
- [x] bb261196-66a5-43af-815d-123fc593cf3a
- [ ] z350mpj1-62lx-40ww-9ho0-4u1875rt2mx4
- [ ] 0x2400001155F04846674AD4590F832C0

- [x] :

```SELECT * FROM Students
   WHERE team NOT 'Chemistry Cats';
```

- [ ] :

```SELECT * FROM Students
   WHERE team <> 'Chemistry Cats';
```

- [ ] :

- [x] `SELECT TOP(2) WITH TIES first_name, department, team FROM Students ORDER BY points;`
- [ ] `SELECT BOTTOM(2) first_name, department, team FROM Students ORDER BY points ASC;`

> the picture of table is important here and there it can be seen that there are only two value with min points. Secondly, the previous answer was wrong because order by `DESC` will put highest points into the beginning of result list and `TOP(2)` will take first two highest points, and we need the lowest points.

select bookid, boooktitle, bookauthor,quantityonhand from inventory.books;
```

- [ ] you only want to see results from books currently in inventory
- [x] it instructs the query engine to find the books table in the inventory schema
- [ ] it instructs the query engine to find the books table in the inventory database
- [ ] it instructs the query engine to join the books table to the inventory schema

> `select * from dbo.books` here `dbo` is a schema and the inventory is also schema. If we'd like to specify a database we should use `db_name.schema_name.table_name`

#### Q29. What is the result of an `INNER JOIN` between table1 and table2?

- [x] Only records that have corresponding entries in table1 and table2 are displayed.
- [ ] No records from table1 are ever displayed.
- [ ] All records from table1 are displayed, regardless of whether the records have a corresponding row in table2
- [ ] Only records that have no corresponding records in table1 or table2 are displayed.

    BookISBN char(13) NOT NULL _____,
    BookTitle nvarchar(100) NOT NULL
);
```

- [ ] `NO DUPLICATES`
- [ ] `UNIQUE CONSTRAINT AK_Books_BookISBN`
- [ ] `DUPLICATE CONSTRAINT (AK_Books_BookISBN)`
- [x] `CONSTRAINT AK_Books_BookISBN UNIQUE`

#### Q32. Given a table with the following structure, which query will not return the lowest grade earned by any student?

```tsql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentName varchar(50),
    Grade int
);
```

- [ ] :

```tsql
SELECT StudentName
FROM Students
WHERE Grade = (SELECT MIN(Grade) FROM Student);
```

- [ ] :

```tsql
SELECT TOP(1) Grade
FROM Students
ORDER BY Grade;
```

- [ ] :

```tsql
SELECT MIN(Grade)
FROM Students
```

- [x] :

```tsql
SELECT MIN(Grade)
FROM Students
ORDER BY Grade;
```

**Explanation:** Column `Students.Grade` is invalid in the `ORDER BY` clause because it is not contained in either an aggregate function or the `GROUP BY` clause.

- [x] :

```tsql
SELECT MIN(Grade)
FROM Students
GROUP BY Grade;
```

**Explanation:** Grouping will return a list of all grades grouped by grade. The prompt wants just one returned row.

```tsql
DECLARE @Counter int;
SET @Counter = 1;
WHILE @Counter > 0

END;
```

- [ ] There is no END WHILE statement;
- [ ] The local varaible is not available to the WHILE block.
- [x] The query causes an infinite loop.
- [ ] "Counter" is an invalid variable name.

GROUP BY OrderID
ORDER BY OrderID;
```

- [x] Yes, a `WHERE` clause cannot be used with an aggregate function.
- [ ] Yes, you cannot `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` the same field.
- [ ] No, there is nothing wrong with this query.
- [ ] Yes, the `WHERE` clause should use the `SubTotal` alias.
