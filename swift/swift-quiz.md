#### Q8. What is the value of y?

```swift
let x = ["1", "2"].dropFirst()
let y = x[0]
```

- [x] This code contains an error
- [ ] `1`
- [ ] `2`
- [ ] `nil`

**explanation**  
`dropFirst()` from `Swift.Collection.Array` returns a type of `ArraySlice<Element>`   
as in the documentation pages:  
`@inlinable public func dropFirst(_ k: Int = 1) -> ArraySlice<Element>`  

The ArraySlice type makes it fast and efficient for you to perform operations on sections of a larger array. Instead of copying over the elements of a slice to new storage, an ArraySlice instance presents a view onto the storage of a larger array. And because ArraySlice presents the same interface as Array, you can generally perform the same operations on a slice as you could on the original array.  

**Slices Maintain Indices**  
Unlike Array and ContiguousArray, the starting index for an ArraySlice instance isnâ€™t always zero. Slices maintain the same indices of the larger array for the same elements, so the starting index of a slice depends on how it was created, letting you perform index-based operations on either a full array or a slice.  
The above code returns a slice of value `["2"]` but the index did not change. `let y = x[1]` would give the expected result.  
To safely reference the starting and ending indices of a slice, always use the startIndex and endIndex properties instead of specific values.
