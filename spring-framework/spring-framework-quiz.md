## Spring Framework

#### Q1. How filters are used in Spring Web?

- [x] Filters are called before a request hits the DispatcherServlet. They allow for interception-style, chained processing of web requests for security, timeouts, and other purposes.
- [ ] Filters are used with a checksum algorithm that will filter invalid bytes out of a byte stream request body and allow for processing of HTTP requests from the DispatcherRequestServlet.
- [ ] Filters are used with a checksum algorithm that will filter invalid bytes out of an octet stream a multipart upload and allow for chained processing of WebDispatcherServlet requests.
- [ ] Filters are used to validate request parameters out of the byte stream request body and allow for processing of requests from the DispatcherRequestServlet.

[HandlerInterceptors vs. Filters in Spring MVC](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-mvc-handlerinterceptor-vs-filter). Also there is no such thing as DispatcherRequestServlet in Spring.

#### Q2. How is a resource defined in the context of a REST service?

- [ ] A resource is the actual String literal that composes a URI that is accessed on a RESTful web service.
- [x] It is an abstract concept that represents a typed object, data, relationships, and a set of methods that operate on it that is accessed via a URI.
- [ ] A REST service has a pool of resources composed of allocations of memory that allow a request to be processed.
- [ ] A resource for a REST service is an explicit allocation of a thread or CPU cycles to allow a request to be processed.

#### Q3. Which of these is a valid Advice annotation?

- [ ] @AfterError
- [x] @AfterReturning
- [ ] @AfterException
- [ ] @AfterExecution

#### Q4. What does a ViewResolver do?

- [ ] It supports internationalization of web applications by detecting a user's locale.
- [x] It generates a view by mapping a logical view name returned by a controller method to a view technology.
- [ ] It creates a unique view determined by the uers's browser type,supporting cross-browser compatibility.
- [ ] It maps custom parameters to SQL views in the database, allowing for dynamic content to be created in the response.

#### Q5. How are Spring Data repositories implemented by Spring at runtime?

- [ ] Spring automatically generated code for you based on your YAML config that defined a MethodInterceptor chain that intercept calls to the instance and computed SQL on the fly.
- [x] A JDK proxy instance is created, which backs the repository interface, and a MethodInterceptor intercepts calls to the instance and routes as required.
- [ ] The Spring JDK proxy creates a separate runtime process that acts as an intermediary between the database and the Web server, and intercepts calls to the instance and handles requests.
- [ ] Spring automatically generated code for you based on your XML config files that define a SpringMethodAutoGeneration factory that intercepts calls to the instance and creates dynamic method that computer SQL on the fly.

#### Q6. What is SpEL and how is it used in Spring?

- [ ] SpEL(Spring Expression Language) runs in the JVM and can act as a drop-in replacement for Groovy or other languages.
- [x] SpEL(Spring Expression Language) supports boolean and relational operators and regular expressions, and is used for querying a graph of objects at runtime.
- [ ] SpEL(Spring Expression Language) allows you to build, configure,and execute tasks such as building artifacts and downloading object dependencies.
- [ ] SpEL(Spring Expression Language) natively transpiles one JVM language to another, allowing for greater flexibility.

#### Q7. The process of linking aspects with other objects to create an advised object is called

- [ ] dynamic chaining
- [ ] banding
- [x] weaving
- [ ] interleaving

#### Q8. How are JDK Dynamic proxies and CGLIB proxies used in Spring?

- [x] JDK Dynamic proxy can proxy only interface, so it is used if the target implements at least one interface. A CGLIB proxy can create a proxy by subclassing and is used if the target does not implement an interface.
- [ ] Only JDK Dynamic proxies are used in the Spring Bean Lifecycle. CGLIB proxies are used only for integrating with other frameworks.
- [ ] Only CGLIB proxies are used in the Spring Bean Lifecycle. JDK Dynamic proxies are used only for integrating with other frameworks.
- [ ] JDK Dynamic proxy can only using an abstract class extended by a target. A CGLIB proxy can create a proxy through bytecode interweaving and is used if the target does not extend an abstract class.

- [x] 1. @PostConstruct 2. afterPropertiesSet() 3. init-method
- [ ] 1. init-method 2. afterPropertiesSet() 3. @PostConstruct
- [ ] You cannot use these methods together-you must choose only one.

#### Q11. What is the function of the `@Transactional` annotation at the class level?

- [ ] It's a transaction attribute configured by `spring.security.transactions.xml` config file that uses Spring's transaction implementation and validation code.
- [ ] It's a transaction that must actively validate by the bytecode of a transaction using Spring's `TransactionBytecodeValidator` class. Default Transaction behavior rolls back on validation exception but commits on proper validation
- [x] It creates a proxy that implements the same interface(s) as the annotated class, allowing Spring to inject behaviors before, after, or around method calls into the object being proxied.
- [ ] It's a transaction that must be actively validated by Spring's `TransactionValidator` class using Spring's transaction validation code. Default Transaction behavior rolls back on validation exception.

#### Q12. Which is a valid example of the output from this code (ignoring logging statements) ?

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class App {
     public static void main(String args[]) {

     }
}
```

- [ ] Nothing will print
- [ ] startup
      init

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Question14.class, args);
    }
}

@Component
class Service {}
```

- [ ] The application will result in a compile error because you can't autowire a private variable.
- [ ] The application will compile and run, and service will have its dependency correctly injected by Spring.
- [x] The application will compile and run, but service will not be autowired because you cannot autowire a static class member.
- [ ] The application will result in a compile error because you attempted to autowire a static variable.

#### Q61. What is a security context?

- [x] The security context includes details of the principal currently using the app, which is stored by default in a `ThreadLocal` in an `Authentication` object.
- [ ] The security context holds a list of all users and their encrypted passwords in memory and a list of resources that users are able to access.
- [ ] The security context includes information about safe network IDs and IP addresses that are able to access the system.
- [ ] The security context includes information about permissions on the local file system describing how local file resources can be accessed.

#### Q62. How might you map an incoming request to a controller method?

- [ ] Annotate a Controller class with `@Controller`. Then, using a specific naming convention for the methods, the `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` will automatically configure your endpoints with the proper HTTP verb and URI.
- [ ] Register a controller as a bean. Then, using a specific naming convention for the methods, the `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` will automatically configure your endpoints based on values from the YAML config file.
- [x] Annotate a controller method with `@RequestMapping`, or a HTTP verb-specific annotation with a String URI pattern parameter (and other params as needed), which is supported through a `RequestMappingHandlerMapping/Adapter`.
- [ ] Register a controller as a bean. Then, using a specific naming convention for the methods, the RequestMappingHandlerAdapter will automatically configure your endpoints based on values passed into the bean definition.

[Spring RequestMapping](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-requestmapping). Spring does not use naming conventions for web requests (unlike e.g. for the Data Repositories)

#### Q63. What methods does the Pointcut expression below reference?

`execution(* setter*(..))`

- [ ] any method with a name that contains the String "setter" with a single parameter
- [ ] any method with a name that begins with String "setter" with a single parameter
- [x] any method with a name that begins with String "setter"
- [ ] any method with a name that contains the String "setter"

- [x] any join point within the service package or one of its subpackages

#### Q66. What is the output from invoking this Actuator endpoint in an unmodified Spring Boot application generated using Spring Intializr?

`/shutdown`

- [x] The request would fail because the endpoint is disabled by default.
- [ ] The Spring Boot app would return a URL and a list of currently running processes, and ask you to confirm the shutdown command.
- [ ] The Spring Boot app would return a URL to confirm the shutdown command.
- [ ] The Spring Boot app would begin shutting down.

Reason: By default, all the endpoints are enabled in Spring Boot Application except /shutdown; this is, naturally, part of the Actuator endpoints.

#### Q67. How can you access the application context in a Spring integration test?

- [ ] The context is present in a ThreadLocal so you can just call getSpringApplicationContextInstance() anywhere in a test to get the current context.
- [x] Test classes can implement the ApplicationContextAware interface or autowire the ApplicationContext.
- [ ] The context is automatically injected in every test so you can just call getSpringApplicationContextInstance() anywhere in a test to get the current context.
- [ ] You can just add the parameter Context context to any method so that the context is automatically wired in.

}
```

- [ ] This endpoint is designed to delete an object of the typetype Pojo with the passed in path variable
- [x] This endpoint is designed to return JSON mapped to the object type Pojo with the passed in id.
- [ ] This endpoint returns the path variable that describes the Pojo's location within the container.
- [ ] This endpoint is designed to update an existing resource of the object type Pojo with the passed in id.

- [ ] profiles

#### Q71. Which statement is true regarding loading and instantiation of Spring factories?

- [ ] During startup, the SpringFactoryInitializr collects all files in the CONFIG-INF directory from each dependency and downloads binaries to run each file.
- [x] During startup, the SpringFactoriesLoader gets a list of config and collects all the files in META-INF directory from dependencies. Then it builds a composite list for application context configurations.
- [ ] During shutdown, the SpringFactoryDestructor collects all the files in META-INF directory from each dependency and begins shutting down each thread and process.
- [ ] During startup and shutdown, the SpringFactoryInitializr downloads project configs for all configured dependencies.

#### Q72. What methods does this Pointcut expression reference?

- [ ] all methods of classes in the com.linkedin.TestService package annotated whith @Service
- [ ] This Pointcut is not valid.
- [ ] all methods defined by the TestService interface

#### Q73. When configuring an application, which configuration is given precedence by Spring?

- [ ] profile specific application-{profile}.properties files
- [ ] Java System Properties
- [ ] application properties located in an application.properties file inside the application.jar
- [x] profile specific application-{profile}.properties files located outside the application.jar

#### Q74. What interface is used to represent a permission in Spring Security?

- [ ] GrantedAuthority
- [ ] SecurityChain
- [ ] PermissionMatrix
- [x] AccessRule

#### Q75. What is the difference between constructor injection and setter injection?

- [ ] Constructor injection overrides setter injection.
- [ ] Setter injection creates a new instance if any modification occurs.
- [x] You can't use constructor injection for partial injection.
- [ ] Constructor injection is more flexible than setter injection.

[Explanation] There are many key differences between constructor injection and setter injection.

Partial dependency: can be injected using setter injection but it is not possible by constructor. Suppose there are 3 properties in a class, having 3 arg constructor and setters methods. In such case, if you want to pass information for only one property, it is possible by setter method only.
Overriding: Setter injection overrides the constructor injection. If we use both constructor and setter injection, IOC container will use the setter injection.
Changes: We can easily change the value by setter injection. It doesn't create a new bean instance always like constructor. So setter injection is flexible than constructor injection.

#### Q76. Which println would you remove to stop this code from throwing a null pointer exception?

```java
@Component
public class Test implements InitializingBean {
     @Autowired
     ApplicationContext context;
     @Autowired
     static SimpleDateFormat formatter;

     @Override
     public void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception {
          System.out.println(context.containsBean("formatter") + " ");
          System.out.println(context.getBean("formatter").getClass());
          System.out.println(formatter.getClass());
          System.out.println(context.getClass());
     }
}
@Configuration
class TestConfig {
     @Bean
     public SimpleDateFormat formatter() {
          return new SimpleDateFormat();
     }
}
```

- [ ] formatter.getClass()
- [ ] context.containsBean("formatter")
- [x] context.getBean("formatter").getClass()
- [ ] context.getClass()

Explanation: Here only one line can throw NPE. Calling getClass() from context.getBean("formatter") can potentially throw NPE if context.getBean("formatter") will return null.

#### Q77. What is the default rollback policy?

- [ ] A rollback is triggered during any error that occurs during the transaction.
- [ ] When an instance or subclass of Exception is thrown, this triggers a rollback, while any runtime exceptions do not.
- [ ] Anytime an instance or subclass of Throwable is thrown, this triggers a rollback.
- [x] When an instance or subclass of RuntimeException is thrown, this triggers a rollback, while any checked Exception does not.

#### Q78. What is the difference between a CrudRepository and a JpaRepository?

- [ ] The CrudRepository extends the PagingAndSortingRepository, while the JpaRepository does not.
- [x] The CrudRepository exposes a superset of interface methods containing every datastore-specific method supported by Spring data. The JpaRepository contains only those specific to Spring Data JPA.
- [ ] The CrudRepository is a base interface within Spring Data core that exposes a dedicated set of functions. The JpaRepository is a store-specific interface that exposes functionality specific to JPA.
- [ ] The CrudRepository is part of the Java EE API, while JpaRepository is specific to Spring Data.

#### Q79. What is the security filter chain?

- [ ] It's a security filter chain that provides authentication with manual intervention such that multiple administrators of the system are able to approve users with auditability and traceability.
- [ ] It's a series of user-completed activities—such as password authorization, token verification, and many others—that require multiple factors of authentication to increase the level of security in the system.
- [x] It's a servlet filter chain where each filter has a specific responsibility such as security context, user and password authorization, exception translation, or filter security interception, processed in order.
- [ ] It's a security filter chain that consumes multiple factors of authentication—such as password, token verification, biometrics, and IP whitelisting—to successfully log a user into the system.

#### Q80. Which is not a valid stereotype annotation?

- [ ] @Component
- [ ] @Service
- [x] @HtmlController
- [ ] @Controller

#### Q81. Which statement is true regarding loading and instantiation of Spring factories?

- [x] During startup, the SpringFactoriesLoader gets a list of configs and collects all the files in META-INF directory from dependencies. Then it builds a composite list for application context configurations.
- [ ] During shutdown, the SpringFactoryDestructor collects all the files in META-INF directory from each dependency and begins shutting down each thread and process.
- [ ] During startup, the SpringFactoryInitializr collects all files in the CONFIG-INF directory from each dependency and downloads binaries to run each file.
- [ ] During startup and shutdown, the SpringFactoryInitializr downloads project configs for all configured dependencies.

#### Q83. What is a transaction isolation level?

- [ ] executing each transaction in its own dedicated threadpool to facilitate thread isolation
- [ ] facilitating each transaction to occur on its own dedicated vCPU to guarantee throughput
- [x] the level of visibility and access a transaction has to the units of work of other transactions such as uncommitted writes
- [ ] executing each transaction on its own process to provide resource isolation

#### Q84. What does the statement "Spring offers fully-typed advice" mean?

- [ ] You declare the parameters you need in the advice signature rather than work with Object[] arrays.
- [ ] You work with a collection of Objects that need to be explicitly casted.
- [x] You work with an array of a Generic type T[] instead of Object[] arrays.
- [ ] You are able to undo type erasure in the Object[] that is exposed

- [ ] A, D, F
- [ ] D, E, F
- [ ] A, B, F
- [x] B, D, E

#### Q85. Which of the Service implementations will be created first?

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class App {

     @Autowired
     Service service;

     public static void main(String[] args) {
          SpringApplication.run(App.class, args);
     }
}
@Primary
@Component
class Service2Impl implements Service {

    Service2Impl() {
        System.out.println("Service2");
    }
}

@Component("Service")
class Service1Impl implements Service {

    Service1Impl() {
        System.out.println("Service1");
    }
}

interface Service{}
```

- [ ] Service1
- [x] Service2
- [ ] A NullPointerException is thrown at runtime.
- [ ] There is no way to know until runtime.
