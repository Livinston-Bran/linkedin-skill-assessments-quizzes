## Microsoft Azure

#### Q1. You need to create an application in Azure AD representing the Kineteco Web App so you can assign directory permissions to the app. To create the application identity, which command will you run?

- [ ] `bash az ad app permission grant -display-name $appName \ ...`
- [ ] `bash az ad app credential create -display-name $appName \ ...`
- [x] `bash az ad app create -display-name $appName \ ...`
- [ ] `bash az ad app permission ass -display-name $appName \ ...`

[Ref](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ad/app?view=azure-cli-latest)

#### Q2. You need to deliver a mobile push notification feature for the Kineteco Retail app, hosted in Azure App Service. The solution should minimize cost, complexity, and development effort. Which option should you choose?

- [x] Notification Hub
- [ ] Event Grid
- [ ] Twilio
- [ ] Service Bus

**Explanation:** Twilio is an SMS notification app, also not from Microsoft. Event Grid can be techincally used for this purpose but it's a more generic event-broadcasting service. Service Bus is another generic publish-subscribe solution. Finally [Notification Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-push-notification-overview) are specifically designed for push-notifications.

#### Q3. Your application hosted in Azure App Service needs to retrieve secrets from Azure Key Vault. Which choice is NOT a way to authenticate to Key Vault?

- [ ] service principal and a certificate
- [ ] managed identity
- [ ] service principal and a secret
- [x] shared access key

[Azure Key Vault Developer's Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/developers-guide#authenticate-to-key-vault-in-code) lists 3 available methods. The _shared access key_ does not exist in Azure at all, the closest term is _shared access signature (SAS)_ but it's used to access Azure Storage only.

#### Q4. You added a persistent volume claim to your apps YAML manifest. When you attempt to deploy to an existing AKS cluster there is no persistent volume available. What should you do?

- [ ] Do nothing. The API server will provision additional storage automatically
- [x] Add a data disk definition for the AKS cluster to your apps YAML manifest
- [ ] Add a data disk to each Kubernetes cluster node and reattempt app deployment
- [ ] Provision an Azure Files instance and reattempt app deployment

#### Q5. Your corporate web application is hosted in Azure regional data centres around the world. You need to route user requests to the closest service endpoint based on response latency. Which routing method should you use?

- [ ] Application gateway
- [ ] Front Door
- [ ] API Management
- [x] Traffic manager

#### Q6. You are developing a release strategy for several related software components. You need to reference variable groups and secure files across multiple build and release pipelines. What is the most efficient way to store and reference these assets from the pipeline?

- [ ] Add the assets to a git repository
- [ ] Add the assets in Key Vault
- [ ] Add the assets to an encrypted volume
- [x] Add the assets to a library

[Ref](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/?view=azure-devops)

#### Q7. You need to grant full access for an app to a temporary Azure storage account. Configuring access should require minimum effort. Which option should you use?

- [ ] Azure AD user account
- [x] Shared access signature
- [ ] Shared key
- [ ] Certificate

[Shared access signature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) exists exactly for the purpose of giving a temporary access. Azure AD user account is not temporary so it needs to be managed. Creating/revoking Certificates for temporary access is just too much hassle.

- [ ] based on a time (schedule)
- [ ] another Azure service (cosmos, service bus)
- [x] threshold alert in Azure App insights

Which solution should you choose?

- [ ] Front door
- [x] API Management
- [ ] Traffic manager

#### Q16. Which access protocol does Azure Files not support?

- [ ] Network File System (NFS)
- [x] HTTPS
- [ ] REST API
- [ ] Server Message Block(SMB)

[What is Azure Files?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction) page mentions the supported protocols.

#### Q17. You are writing an app for a sales team.

You need to ensure that user testing (UAT) is successful before triggering the release pipeline. The process should be automated as possible. What should you add to your build pipeline?

- [ ] Query Work Items gate
- [ ] Manual Intervention task
- [x] Approval gate
- [ ] Invoke REST API gate

#### Q21. The Kineteco Web App is running on AKS. To meet a spike in demand, the horizontal pod autoscaler recently provisioned additional pods, which are no longer needed. What should you do to scale down unnecessary pods?

- [ ] Trigger scale down in Azure Container Instances.
- [ ] Trigger scale down in the HPA from the Azure CLI.
- [ ] Manually deprovision unneeded pods.
- [x] Do nothing. HPA will initiate scale down automatically.

#### Q24. You have set of SQL databases used with various PaaS applications with predictable usage patterns. You are planning to move these databases to Azure SQL and need to choose the right deployment option. Your priorities are minimizing costs, and having the ability to assign CPU and resources to individual databases. Which option should you choose?

- [x] Azure SQL elastic pool
- [ ] SQL on Azure VMs
- [ ] Azure SQL Database
- [ ] SQL Managed Instance

**Explanation:** For many businesses and applications, creating individual databases and scaling performance up or down as needed is sufficient, especially when usage patterns are relatively predictable. Unpredictable usage patterns can make it difficult to manage costs and your business model. Elastic pools aim to solve this problem. Performance resources are allocated to a pool, not to a single database. You pay for the collective performance resources of the pool, not for the performance of a single database.
