MATCH (c:Company {name: 'Neo4j'}) RETURN c, MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.name = 'Jennifer' RETURN p,
MATCH (t:Technology)-[:LIKES]-(a:Person {name: 'Jennifer'}) RETURN t.type;
```

- [x] B

```
MATCH (c:Company {name: 'Neo4j'}) RETURN c, MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.name = 'Jennifer' RETURN p,
MATCH (t:Technology)-[:LIKES]-(a:Person {name: 'Jennifer'}) RETURN t.type
```

- [ ] C

```
MATCH (c:Company {name: 'Neo4j'}) RETURN c AND MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.name = 'Jennifer' RETURN p,
AND MATCH (t:Technology)-[:LIKES]-(a:Person {name: 'Jennifer'}) RETURN t.type;
```

- [ ] D

```
MATCH (c:Company {name: 'Neo4j'}) RETURN c;MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.name = 'Jennifer' RETURN p;
MATCH (t:Technology)-[:LIKES]-(a:Person {name: 'Jennifer'}) RETURN t.type;
```

[Explaination:]The correct Cypher code to execute a multiquery block would use commas to separate each query in a single statement. In this case, option B has all the queries separated by commas, making it the correct choice. Option A has the correct queries, but they are separated by "RETURN" which is not correct syntax for multiquery. Option C has an additional "AND" before the second query which is also not correct syntax. Option D has each query separated by semicolons, which would execute them as separate queries, not as a multiquery block.
