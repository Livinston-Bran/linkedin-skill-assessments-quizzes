#### Q50. Lambda can read events from which other AWS services? (ref-https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-services.html)

- [ ] Kinesis, S3, and SQS
- [ ] Kinesis, S3, and SNS
- [ ] Kinesis, DynamoDB, and SNS
- [x] Kinesis, DynamoDB, and SQS

**Explanation**

- `Lambda can used for all services mentioned on the question: Kinesis, S3, SNS, SQS, DynamoDB. But as you can see in the reference, Lambda's responsibility and method invocation can be categorized by Lambda polling and Event Driven (synchronous invocation). When you implement an event-driven architecture, you grant the event-generating service permission to invoke your function in the function's resource-based policy. Then you configure that service to generate events that invoke your function. When you implement a Lambda polling architecture, you grant Lambda permission to access the other service in the function's execution role. Lambda reads data from the other service, creates an event, and invokes your function. According to this analytics, Kinesis-DynamoDB-SQS use same method invocation, Lambda polling.`

#### Q51. Via what can a Lambda be called?

- [x] all of these answers
- [ ] a DynamoDB trigger
- [ ] an API Gateway
- [ ] an S3 bucket event

**Explanation** (source google)

- `With DynamoDB Streams, you can trigger a Lambda function to perform additional work each time a DynamoDB table is updated. Lambda reads records from the stream and invokes your function synchronously with an event that contains stream records.`
- `These events are considered synchronous events. Simply put, it means that when somebody is calling an API Gateway, it will trigger your Lambda function. It's a synchronous event because your Lambda function has to respond to the client directly at the end of its invocation.`
- `You can use Lambda to process event notifications from Amazon Simple Storage Service. Amazon S3 can send an event to a Lambda function when an object is created or deleted.`

#### 52. which is use case of lambda ?

- [ ] Image processing
- [ ] web application
- [x] both
- [ ] Neither 1st and 2nd

#### Q53. Events are AWS resources that trigger the Lambda function. What data type is the SAM file Events property?

#### Q54. A company is using an API built using Amazon Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and Amazon DynamoDB in production. The developer has observed high latency during peak periods. Which approach would best resolve the issue?

- [x] Enable API Gateway stage-level caching

#### Q55. The AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is a model that \_\_\_\_ .

- [x] defines serverless applications

#### Q56. The code that you want AWS Lambda to invoke as per some defined triggers is known as **\_**.

- [ ] the event source
- [ ] the downstream resource
- [ ] the log stream
- [x] the Lambda function

#### Q57. A developer has created a Lambda function to scrub real-time data of extraneous information and then send the scrubbed data to Kinesis for further processing and storage. Some of the data showing up in Kinesis seems to be inaccurate. What's the best way for the developer to debug this?

- [ ] Look directly at the Lambda Logs in CloudWatch
- [ ] Send the Lambda failures to a Dead Letter Queue
- [x] Use AWS X-Ray to step through the function
- [ ] Use Kinesis to write their own custom logging tool

#### Q58. Lambdas can be created **\_**.

- [ ] From scratch
- [ ] From the app repository

#### Q62. A company will be modernizing their application which is currently running on Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) instances. They have experience with scaling this infrastructure using Amazon EC2 Autoscaling. They want to move to serverless infrastructure consisting of an Amazon API Gateway that triggers Lambda functions. They are consulting you about scaling this new infrastructure. What should the company consider in order to make sure the serverless infrastructure scales to their needs?

- [ ] Enable Auto Scaling Groups for AWS Lambda to ensure that enough Lambda functions are ready to handle the incoming requests
- [ ] Throttle Lambda functions by configuring reserved concurrency, sending the excess traffic to Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) that will be handled when the request volume reduces.
- [x] Look at service limits for Amazon API Gateway and Lambda functions used in order to identify potential bottlenecks and balance performance requirements, costs, and business impact
- [ ] Do nothing. API Gateway and AWS Lambda are managed services that have built-in horizontal scaling, security, and high availability to handle unlimited amount of requests

**Explanation**

In serverless it is important to understand the service limits of all the services used end to end to understand the level of requests that can be handled.
