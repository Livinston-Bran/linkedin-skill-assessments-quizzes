- [ ] ViewModel objects

[Refrence](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/saving-states)

#### Q17. Given the definition below. how would you get access a TextView with an ID of text_home contained in thr layout file of a Fragment class?

- [ ] getDefaultSharedPrefarances(this).getString(EMAIL,null)
- [x] getDefaultSharedPreferances(this).getString(EMAIL,"")
- [ ] getPreferances(this).getString(EMAIL,null)

**Explanation:** `In Method "getDefaultSharedPrefarances(this).getString()" Second parameter is passed so that it can be returned, in case key doesn't exist. So we need to pass an empty string to be returned in case key doesn't exist.`

#### Q20. Why is it problematic to define sizes using pixels on Android?

- [ ] Although screen pixel density varies, this does not impact the use of pixels to define sizes.
- [ ] Large devices always have more pixels, so your UI elements will be e=affected if you define them with pixels.
- [x] The same number of pixels may correspond to different physical sizes, affecting the appearance of your UI elements.
- [ ] Different devices have different understanding of what a pixel is , affecting the appearance of your UI elements

            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:text="Button" />
	<Button
            android:layout_width="wrap_content"

val et = findViewById(R.id.some_edit_text)
dialerIntent.action = Intent.ACTION_DIAL
dialerIntent.data = Uri.parse("tel:" + et.getText()?.toString())
startActivity(dialerIntent)
```

- [x] `startActivityWithResult()` should be used instead of `startActivity()` when using `Intent.ACTION_DIAL`.
- [ ] For `Intent.ACTION_DIAL`, the `Intent` option `Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK` must be added when using this `dialerIntent`.
- [ ] The `dialerIntent` will cause an ActivityNotFoundException to be thrown on devices that do not support `Intent.ACTION_DIAL`.

- [x] when you need access to the original file names and file hierarchy
- [ ] when you need access to the file with its `resource ID`, like `R.assets.filename`
- [ ] when you have XML files that define tween animations
- [ ] when you need to access the file in its raw form using `Resources.openRawResource()`

[Reference](https://medium.com/mobile-app-development-publication/assets-or-resource-raw-folder-of-android-5bdc042570e0)

#### Q32. You want to allow users to take pictures in your app. Which is _not_ an advantage of creating an appropriate `intent`, instead of requesting the camera permission directly?

- [ ] Users can select their favorite photo apps to take pictures.
- [ ] You do not have to make a permission request in your app to take a picture.
- [x] You have full control over the user experience. The app that handles the camera `intent` will respect your design choices.
- [ ] You do not have to design the UI. The app that handles the camera `intent` will provide the UI.

#### Q33. When would you use the `ActivityCompat.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale()` function?

- [ ] when a user first opens your app and you want to provide an explanation for the use of a given permission
- [ ] when a user has previously denied the request for a given permission and selects "Tell me more"
- [ ] when a user has previously denied the request for a given permission and you want to provide an explanation for its use
- [x] when a user has previously denied the request for a given permission and selected "Don't ask again," but you need the permission for your app to function

	}
}
```

#### Q35. To optimize your APK size, what image codec should you use?

[Reference](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/reduce-apk-size#:~:text=packJPG%20and%20guetzli.-,Use%20WebP%20file%20format,than%20either%20JPEG%20or%20PNG.)

#### Q36. You have built code to make a network call and tested that it works in your development environment. However, when you publish it to the Play console, the networking call fails to work. What will _not_ help you troubleshoot this issue?

- [ ] checking whether `ProGuard` -keepclassmembers have been added to the network data transfer objects (DTOs) in question
- [x] using the profiler tools in Android Studio to detect anomalies in CPU, memory, and network usage
- [ ] checking for exceptions in the server logs or server console

- [ ] androidTest
- [ ] app
- [x] main

#### Q39. Which definition will prevent other apps from accessing your `Activity` class via an `intent`?

- [x] A

```xml
	<activity android:name=".ExampleActivity" />
```

- [ ] B

```xml
	<activity android:name=".ExampleActivity">
		<intent-filter>
			<action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND" />
		</intent-filter>
	</activity>
```

- [ ] C

```xml
	<activity android:name=".ExampleActivity">

```xml
	<activity android:name=".ExampleActivity">
		<intent-filter>
			<action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
		</intent-filter>
	</activity>
```

**Explanation:** `Intent filters are used to make activities accessible to other apps using intents. So we have to choose option which have no intent filter to make sure it is not accessible by intent`

#### Q40. To preserve on-device memory, how might you determine that the user's device has limited storage capabilities?

- [x] Use the `ActivityManager.isLowRamDevice()` method to find out whether a device defines itself as "low RAM."
- [ ] Use the `Activity.islowRam()` method to find out whether a device defines itself as "low RAM."
- [ ] Use the `ConnectivityManager.hasLowMemory()` method to find out whether a device defines itself as "low RAM."

- [ ] The Application class is created each time a new Activity is launched, making it ideal for initialization code.
- [ ] The Application class is created each time a background service is called, making it ideal for initialization code.
